 # Building Workflows with Snakemake

## What we did in class

We started from the repository:

https://github.com/lachlandeer/snakemake-econ-r-learner

and gradually built up a Snakefile to build our:

1. OLS estimates
2. Figures
3. A regression table

In class, the final regression table wasn't building.
I fixed this.
The final version of our Snakefile, and entire MRW replication from class is located:

## Reference material from today

Julian and I are working on a extended tutorial that explains how to use snakemake to build a entire project.
It uses the same exaple as today, but uses a different order - because it's designed for more than 6 hours of teaching.

## Extra Material

In `2017-material` there are slides and examples from the 2017 version of the course. 
It uses different examples (in python), but might be useful to look over.
